Register your FarmBeats Student Kit User and Device
===================================================

To get your FarmBeats Student Kit devices connected to the cloud you need to
register the unique ID from each device and get it provisioned to the Azure IoT
Central Cloud Service.

The FarmBeats Student Kit portal makes this easier for you by providing you with
a simple way to register your user and then your device so configuration of the
cloud service is done for you.

*Note: It is recommended that you start your web browser in a Private Mode to
avoid conflicts with the username that you might already being logged into other
sites with.*

Register your user at the FarmBeats Student Kit Portal
------------------------------------------------------

-   Please check the URL on the outside of the Student Kit or on the Getting
    Started Guide and visit the portal using that URL.

    -   If you have received your Student Kit from your school or other
        educational organization then it’s likely that you would have a
        customized registration process. E.g. <https://aka.ms/fbsk-schoolname>

    -   If you have received your Student Kit independent of an educational
        organization then just use the base URL of <https://aka.ms/fbsk>

-   To login for the first time click either the Login or the Activate Your Kit
    button on the home page. Note: In the top right of the page it will show if
    you are logged in already. If you are already logged in with an account that
    you don’t want to use for the Student Kit then log out and visit the page
    again.

-   Enter your user name and password.

*Note: If you don’t already have a Microsoft Work or School account or a
Microsoft Account like an Outlook, Live or Hotmail user name then this process
will create a MSA on top of your existing email address.*

-   If it’s your first time logging in then you will be redirected to the User
    Registration Page. If you have logged in before you will need to select
    Activate your Kit from the Getting Started section.

    fill out any information the might be customized specific to the
    organization you are affiliated with.

    to accept from the nearest town and not to the exact address.*

-   Once you have filled out the form you will need to select any confirmation
    boxes for policies on this page.

-   Submit the form to complete the account creation. You have now registered
    your user.

-   From there the next steps are to register your device or devices.

Register your devices
---------------------

*The FarmBeats Student Kit cloud service is provided for free up to a 5 device
limit per user. Any additional devices over the 5 device limit will incur cost.
Devices added over the free limit will be programmatically removed unless
billing information is provided. Please* [contact
us](mailto:support@farmbeatslabs.com) *to arrange.*

-   To register your Student Kit device you are going to need a unique **Device
    ID** to use as the claim code. The Device ID that we use is from the Mac
    address of the LAN adapter on your Raspberry Pi. Instructions for obtaining
    the claim code are in part 1 of the instructions for setting up your device.

-   When you have registered your first device the provisioning process will
    start and the portal will generate your Azure IoT Central application and
    add your device.

-   When the provisioning process is complete you will be sent a confirmation
    email and be redirected to the Student Kit Portal profile page.

-   In the email and on the profile page you will be able to see your Azure IoT
    Central URL. There is a copy icon beside this field to copy the URL to the
    clipboard.

-   If you get an error message about the URL being incorrect, please ensure that you
    are not logged into any other Microsoft Accounts. You have two options: either signout
    of your other account, or open a new browser window in a private mode then login and try
    to access the Azure IoT Central URL again.

### User account and device registration complete

-   You have now completed the User and Device registration and the Azure IoT
    Central application has been created and your device has been added to your
    cloud application. You can now proceed to [Step 3 – Configure your Azure IoT

    Service](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/3_Configure_your_Azure_IoT_Central_Cloud_Service.md)
