What are the components that make up the kit
--------------------------------------------

The FarmBeats Student Kit Indoor M1 is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution that
is made up of several technology components that include the cloud and the
device.

**Windows 10 IoT Core operating system**

Windows 10 IoT Core is the smallest member of the Windows 10 family that brings
power, security and manageability to the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows
individuals and organizations to create secure devices that can be quickly
provisioned, easily managed, and seamlessly connected to the cloud.

**Grove system and sensors**

Grove is an electronics system that simplifies connections to hundreds of
different sensors, so you can program them to monitor, control, and automate
devices. Sensors included in the kit: soil moisture, light, air temperature and
humidity.

**Azure IoT Central cloud service**

Azure IoT Central is a fully managed Internet of Things (IoT)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that makes it easy to create products that
connect the physical and digital worlds, monitor, and manage your IoT devices.

**Azure Maps geospatial data browsing**

Add maps, search, routing, and traffic capabilities to your apps with geospatial
services APIs that integrate seamlessly with other Azure tools and services.
